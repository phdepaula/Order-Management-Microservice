# 📄 Sales Management Microservice
Microservice responsible for managing the sales order flow of a system, controlling access to other services and also consulting the ViaCep external API to obtain updated address information.

This project was developed for my full-stack development specialization and is related to two more microservices.

##  📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and running on your machine.

Once this is done, check if the external network **puc-microservice** is already created.
To check, run the following command in the terminal:

```
docker network ls
```

If the network does not exist, run the following command to create it:

```
docker network create puc-microservice
```

Additionally, some routes access the online-store-microservice, make sure it is active.
For more information on its creation, access its [repository](https://github.com/phdepaula/Online-Store-Microservice).

## ▶️ How to run

To start the application, simply run via terminal:

```
docker-compose up
```
